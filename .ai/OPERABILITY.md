# Operability Gates

## Current computed state
- Development usable: **PASS**
- Internal testing ready: **PASS**
- External beta/testing ready: **FAIL**
- Real prospect ready: **FAIL**
- Production ready: **FAIL**
- Weighted real-world operability: **39%**
- Remaining to full operability: **61%**
- M1 business readiness: **~95%**
- Real-SMB digital presence validation: **ACTIVE / 0 of 10 weighted points earned**
- M2 deployment tooling: **IMPLEMENTED / PARTLY TESTED IN CI / NOT DEPLOYED**
- REAL OUTREACH COUNT: **0**

Operability history:
- 33% → 36%: recurring/reporting/exception operating controls completed.
- 36% → 37%: Access Authorization and SOW/Change Order business-reconciled.
- 37% → 38%: Ireland first-market tax/invoice operating reference completed.
- 38% → 39%: EU/EEA transfer decisioning and Ireland-first dental/healthcare data/content operating boundaries completed.

Repository implementation, CI and architecture work after 39% do **not** automatically increase real-world operability. DEPLOYED / EXTERNALLY VERIFIED / PRODUCTION APPROVED / REAL-CUSTOMER PROVEN states require separate evidence.

## Weighted path to 100%
The weighting now explicitly reserves real-world credit for proving SMB digital-presence value. Infrastructure/provider completion alone can never reach 100%.

- A Product engineering + synthetic lifecycle: **20%** — current 20/20.
- B M1 business operating layer: **20%** — current ~19/20 (~95%).
- C Real-SMB digital presence validation: **10%** — current 0/10.
- D M2 production infrastructure: **12%** — current 0/12 real-world credit.
- E M3 external providers/accounting: **8%** — current 0/8.
- F M4 production validation: **8%** — current 0/8.
- G M5 integrated actual-provider dry run: **8%** — current 0/8.
- H M6 human operator acceptance: **4%** — current 0/4.
- I First controlled prospect + paid activation: **5%** — current 0/5.
- J First recurring customer cycle: **4%** — current 0/4.
- K Closure/economics/no unresolved P0/P1: **1%** — current 0/1.

Total current weighted operability: **39/100**.

## Gate 1 — Development usable — PASS
Repository/package/application entrypoints exist and the current verified code baseline is green.

## Gate 2 — Internal testing ready — PASS
Latest fully verified code evidence: commit `9770c4c4885382e507ee113042949a3e48ab65f3`, GitHub Actions run `33947738399`, success across Terraform validation, Linux Ruff/mypy/pytest/audit/browser/discovery/commercial acceptance and Windows portability/sales-contract/operator Playwright.

## M1 — Business-ready operating layer — ACTIVE (~95%)
Operating scope, activation/recurring SOP, payment/access/change/reporting/support/offboarding, Ireland tax/invoice, EU/EEA transfer decisioning and dental/healthcare data/content boundaries are defined. Remaining blockers are qualified production approval where required, actual transaction tax treatment, exact production-provider/entity/location evidence and clean approved customer-facing release set.

## C — Real-SMB digital presence validation — ACTIVE (#297)
Purpose: prove that VERIDRA + Webify Presence Care creates credible, understandable, remediable and recurring value for real SMBs rather than only passing synthetic website tests.

Initial market: Ireland.
Initial vertical: independent dental practices.

No C credit is earned merely by creating the protocol or discovering businesses.

Credit requires progressively stronger evidence from `docs/validation/smb-digital-presence-validation.md` and GitHub #297:
1. reproducible 25–50 real-business cohort;
2. bounded public digital-presence assessments;
3. 10–15 manually validated businesses with false-positive/miss/commercial-value/operator-time metrics;
4. 3–5 no-contact shadow Presence Care deliveries;
5. explicit evidence-backed recurring-value decision for the Ireland €99/month model.

Hard rule: sampled businesses are **not outreach targets during this track**. Do not contact them, submit forms, authenticate, modify systems or cross VERIDRA's bounded-public assessment boundary.

## M2 — Production infrastructure — ACTIVE, external evidence absent
Implemented/tested repository evidence includes provider-neutral single-host deployment, Hetzner Terraform, Caddy TLS boundary, worker supervision, quiesced local backup and encrypted Backblaze B2 replication.

No M2 real-world credit is granted until evidence proves a real host, provider firewall, DNS/TLS, durable state, worker execution, real scheduled backup, independent off-host snapshot and isolated restore.

## M3 — External providers/accounting — ACTIVE, external evidence absent
Brevo, Stripe business-billing boundary and the Stripe → Webify accounting → VERIDRA ledger structure are selected/defined. No provider/accounting credit is granted until real sandbox/account/configuration and reconciliation evidence exists.

## Gate 3 — External beta/testing ready — FAIL
Requires real deployed infrastructure, real SMTP/public-origin identity-email flows, production preflight/deployment checks, operational health/logging and no unresolved P0 affecting tester data/safety.

## Gate 4 — Real prospect ready — FAIL
Requires external-beta readiness **and** #297 real-SMB digital-presence validation, Stripe sandbox lifecycle, accounting/invoice exercise, usable/approved Priority-A paperwork, complete actual-provider dry run, no first-customer P0/P1 and Rafael's explicit #284 approval. **No real outreach permitted.**

## Gate 5 — Production ready — FAIL
Requires exact release/config/evidence freeze, secret management, verified backups/restore, observability, provider go-live decisions, runbook and human operator acceptance.

## Fully operative definition
100% means VERIDRA/Webify has proven all weighted gates above, including real-SMB digital-presence value, and at least one real paying customer completes activation and at least one recurring service/payment cycle successfully, with reconciliation, monitoring/reporting, measured operator economics and no unresolved P0/P1 operational gap.
